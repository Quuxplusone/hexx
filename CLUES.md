In this European import, you direct the actions of a quartet
of adventurers on a quest to discover four magic games and
replace them in a tower. The quest is lengthy, consisting
of exploring mazes where you push buttons to alter the
structure and open new doors or remove blocked passages.
These feats are accomplished by finding keys, unlocking
doors, and pushing buttons to get into the next area â€”
where you start looking for more keys. Unlike most
American games, HEXX does not employ first-person graphics that
show the game through the eyes of your party. Instead, you see an
isometric view that depicts them from overhead view at an oblique angle.
An auto-map helps significantly, and the Regeneration Chamber for reviving dead characters
will see a lot of use. A novel "Restore Game" feature shows a picture of the scene
where you saved each game, making it easier to load the one you want. While the
magic spells and combat can be fun, the repetitive nature of the "puzzles," which
consist mainly of finding keys and pushing buttons, put a hex on HEXX's chance of
getting more than a nod from this reviewer.

The Solution
============

General
-------

In most instances you carry only one key at a time, so you know what to do next:
find the door that the key you are carrying will unlock.

To progress through each level, push all the buttons and pull all levers you find,
then check your map to see what has changed: you will usually see that a path or
wall has been opened, or an obstacle has been moved out of your way.

Characters & Gear
-----------------

Use two Mages: Mad Meg, who has Confuse from the outset, and later can cast
Wychwind and Mindrage, and Zothen Runecaster, who can cast Damage.

You also need Two Warriors up front to keep the monsters away from the Mages.

Get a bow and arrows for the rear characters, who can do real damage with
the Hail of Doom-type arrows from a Harvester bow (with Archer skill the
damage is about 450).

Swords range from a short sword to a Rune sword, and the battle Staff
can be wielded from the rear rank; the best armor is Crystal Plate.

There are a number of Magic rings, staffs and wands, but you will need a
Recharge spell to regenerate them after about seven uses. But if you sell
them to a shop and repurchase them, they will be fully charged.

There is a Regeneration Chamber in the southwest section of Level 6, where
you start; a bed is in the lower left center.

There are also two shops on this level, selling armor, weapons, food,
scrolls and potions.

Helpful Hints
-------------

Sleeping in beds will restore Hit Points and Magic Points to the maximum,
and also gives you an opportunity to buy magic spells.

Regeneration Chambers will return your Hit Points to the maximum,
but not your Magic Points.

Shops sell armor, weapons, food, torches, rings, amulets, potions and spells
(there are no Shops outside of the Keep, so stock up on lots of food and
torches before leaving the Keep to enter the structures.

Alternatively, you can use the Torch spell (if you have it) to provide light.

Travelling & Keys
-----------------

Backpacks will hold up to twelve items, but only count as one item in your
inventory slots.

Each Monster you slay will drop a bag of gold and sometimes a key; you must
also buy or find "Common Keys" to unlock "Common Doors".

Pile common keys together to save space.

Throughout this quest you will constantly be going up a level, then down,
then up, then down, and so on. The important thing is to cover all areas
on all Levels in your search for keys. Consult your map frequently.

The Keep
--------

You begin in the Keep on Level 6, where the initial objective is to reach the
center of this level and find four Teleport Pads, which will transport you to
other areas of this level, including the stairs down to Level 5.

Eventually you must progress down to Level 1 and back up to Level 6, until
you have mapped all areas except for two: in the northwest corner of Level 6
is a room with four openings in the wall, where you will place the artifacts
you acquire.

The other area you will not have yet mapped is on Level 4, where you will
encounter four locked gates leading to the four main structures that you must
enter in order to obtain the four artifacts necessary to completing the game.

Mapping all of the Keep in this linear manner will eventually result in the
acquisition of a key that unlocks the gate to the first of these structures,
the one to the north, which leads to Grisslem's Tower.

Level Six
---------

Look at your automap and explore this level until all five switches appear
on the map:

Switch 1 is to the north.

Switch 2 is in the southeast, facing a column that bars your path.

Switch 3 is in the southeast.

Switch 4 is in the middle western side of the map.

Switch 5 is south of Switch 4.

Go north to Switch 1 (watch out for the teleportal just north) and pull the red switch.

This causes the column in the southeast to face north.

Go to Switch 5 and push the gray button, which removes the column and allows access to Switch 2.

Push the green button, which rotates Switch 4.

Go to Switch 3 and pull the red lever, which allows you to reach Switch 4.

Pull the green lever.

Go west to the teleport pad, which takes you north to the Ruby Key

Step back on the pad to leave the area.

Go northeast opposite the shop, use the Ruby Key and get the Sun key.

Level Five
----------

Go to Level 5 and through the west door.

Go down the Hall and get a Crystal Key.

To deal with the monsters just released, run down the hall and exit, then
turn and fight them (close the door if you need some time to heal).

As you work your way down, you will have to move back and forth between
floors to make progress; watch out for Spinners.

The Gems
--------

After you get each Gem, return to Level 6 and place it in a pocket.

This opens a door further west and allows you to proceed to another Tower.

On the last trip, take all four Gems back to the Wizard's Tower.

The Eye doubles your strength while being carried and renews the entire party when placed in the wall.

The Tear doubles dexterity and restores magic points.

The Heart doubles constitution and restores vitality.

The Horn doubles intelligence and Vivifies the party.

Stonewalled
-----------

To get past the stone wall on Level 6, you must find a key on Level 5, which
will open the rest of Level 6's northwest section.

Next work your way to Level 1, then back up to Level 5 and open the
stairway to Level 6.

Go back down to Level 4, then go north to the entrance to the Tower of Grisslem.

The Tower of Grisslem
---------------------

Start up the east stairs of this eight-level tower.

Get the Eye from the north-central wall on Level 8.

Go back down to Level 7 and drop down into the pit to reach Level 6
(there is a regeneration chamber on this floor) .

Look for a blue button in the southeast corner, then use the steps from
Level 6 to reach Level 5.

Descend to Level 4 by going north via the spinner.

Go east and south, then enter the south pit to reach Level 3
(a pit in the south on Level 3 will take you to Level 1).

Use the teleportal to return to Level 4 of the Keep.

Go to the southeast corner and take the steps to Level 5.

Go to Level 6, then head west and put the Eye in the proper hole, which will open a door to the west.

Take the door to the south, and you will find a key that opens the next tower.

Go south on Level 4, open the door with the night key and use the teleportal
in the south to reach the Demesne of Shaspouk.

The Demesne of Shaspouk
-----------------------

Go south and up to Level 2 (you'll find an Armorer and a magic shop on
this level).

Visit every part of Level 2, then go north and use the west hall to get
to the stairs on Level 3.

On Level 3, cover every square foot completely, then go to the southeast
corner and take the two sets of stairs to Level 4.

On Level 4, a spinner teleports you back to where you started: when you go
north, try to move to one tile away from the north wall.

When you see a sign, run the Gauntlet: use the pads one at a time and kill
each monster as it appears.

In the south alcove, press button one (between the second and third projection)
to open the east door and reach the stairs to Level 5 (there is a Regeneration
Chamber on Level 5).

The stairs up are in a room in the northeast area: cover the whole floor for keys.

On Level 6, explore the floor, then take the stairs in the southeast quadrant
to Level 7.

Using the Night Key from Level 6, go to the northeast comer and push the blue
button behind the fake wall.

Go to the southwest comer and go through another fake wall, then go west,
north and east and get the Tear.

Use the steps down to Level 6, and go to Level 5 via the pit in the central-east room.

Take the steps to Level 4, then go around west and north, then south to
the stairs that lead to Level 3.

Use the pit in the center to reach Level 2, and take the steps to Level 1.

Teleport back to Level 6 of the Keep and place the Tear in the slot.

Go west and south to get the Ruby Key.

Go to Level 4, use the Ruby Key in the south room and use the teleport to get to the Citadel of Angrath.

The Citadel of Angrath
----------------------

Take the steps to Level 2, a tough level with numerous fake walls and spinners.

Cover the entire floor, get the Ruby Key from the center room, then go to the northwest
quadrant and use the key on the west side to get to the stairs that lead to Level 3.

On Level 3, get the Gold Key that opens the southwest corner and leads to the stairs up.

On Level 4, get the Ruby Key in the small north-central room.

With the Ruby Key, go north, west and south to reach the stairs to Level 5.

On Level 5, use Antimage to counteract the Arcbolts; some squares here will
remove your spell, so you can die often.

Find the safe squares (save the game when you discover one), recast the spell
and heal yourselves, then move on.

Go to the northwest, then east and south for the stairs to Level 6.

On Level 6, the stairs up are in the northwest.

In the center of Level 7 are two sets of stairs on the left and right: use either one.

On Level 8, use the Ruby Key to get the Heart.

Return to Level 1, use the teleport on 2, then return to Level 6 and put the
Heart in its slot. Go west for the Sun key, which opens the Tower of Xtlaltic.

The Tower of Xtlaltic
---------------------

Use the Sun Key to enter and clear out the south room, then use the teleport to Level 1.

Now work your way up to Level 7, in search of the Horn.

On Level 2 you will need Levitate spells; also watch out for spinners.

You'll find a shop and a Regeneration Chamber on Level 2.

Move to the southwest to take the stairs up to Level 3, where you will need a Sun Key.

Go south and west to the stairs up to Level 4, then on to Level 5.

Return to Level 4 via the pit, take another pit back to Level 3, then
another pit to Level 2 and back up to Level 5 and Level 6.

Save the game.

Drop down into the pit.

Cast Levitate, and while passing a green button, press it
(this removes a column to the north on Level 4).

Go north to Level 4 and get the Ruby Key.

Go down the pit to Level 3, cancel Levitate and go south to the steps down
to Level 2 (you can also find a good weapon north of here) .

Go back to Level 5 via the southwest steps and go down the pit to Level 4.
Go north and down the pit to Level 3.

Save the game.

The Horn
--------

On Level 3, go to the northwest room and move up and down levels between
this room and one in the northwest on the Level 6.

Save the game, then use the left teleport pad to go up to Level 6.

Step on the pad in front of the blue button, step off and back on again,
push the blue button and step off again.

Push red button and step to the teleport pad in back, which transports
you to Level 3.

Use the right teleport pad again to reach Level 6, then push the green
button and go to the rear teleport pad, Level 3.

Step on the left teleport pad and go to Level 6.

Push the green button and use the rear pad on Level 3.

Use the right teleport (Level 6), then press the red button and get
the Night Key out of the room in back of you.

Step on the pad in front of the blue button, step off, then step on
and off again.

Step on the rear teleport pad to reach Level 3, then step on the center
teleport pad and teleport to the exit hall.

Press the blue button to create a second blue button; press this,
and you are arrive on Level 6.

Go to Level 5 and use the pit to reach Level 4.

Use the pits or stairs to reach Level 2.

The Horn at Last
----------------

Go up the stairs to Level 3 and use the Sun Key.

Finish visiting every part of this level (take the steps down in the northeast
area to completely finish it, particularly the southeast part).

Then use the stairs to reach Level 4.

Explore Level 4, noting the pit in the northwest, which you will use later.

Go northeast and take the stairs to Level 5, which is filled with spinners on
this floor.

Find the Ruby Key, then go south of it for the Night key.

Go south through a fake wall and use the Ruby Key on the door.

Move east to a pad on front of a door; the pad rotates the door.

Step on the pad, then off and on, until you are able to go west through the door.

Then go south and east to another pad, which revolves the door you just came
through: stand on it until you can go south.

Return to this door and get the Sun Key, then use it to the north and get the Gold Key.

Go to the second pad, near the southeast corner, and stand on it three times, so that the
room where you got Sun Key revolves from to south to west access.

Use the Gold Key on the west door, and you'll find stairs to Level 6.

On Level 6, you must go to the northeast corner to find stairs to Level 7.

Go south and drop through a pit to Level 6.

Go south on Level 6 through two doors, then east and get the Sun and Silver Keys.

Use the Silver Key to open a door to the southeast, and again go up to Level 7.

Just west of the stairs is a Sun Key, and to the west, a yellow button.

Press the yellow button to remove a pillar to the north, then go there and use the Sun Key.

Press the yellow button to the east.

Use the second Sun Key to open a door to the northwest room, then press the
yellow button there (this opens the door to the center).

Return to the back of the column and press yet another yellow button, which
removes a teleport pad from in front of the Horn.

Take the Horn.

Into the Wizard's Tower
-----------------------

Descend into the pit on the west side to reach Level 6.

In the east part of the central area, enter the pit to Level 5.

Take the northeast stairs to Level 4.

In the northeast room on Level 4 are two pits: use the southern one to
reach Level 3.

Take the south steps to Level 2, then the east steps to Level 1 (you must use
the Crystal Key to get out).

Take the Horn to Level 6 and insert it into the slot, which opens the way
to the Wizard's Tower.

Take all four items before leaving Level 6.

None Shall Pass
---------------

Note the teleport pad you arrive on: if you want to leave the building
you can do so at any time.

You must get to the southeast corner, then proceed north to reach the steps
to Level 2. In the center is a sign: "None shall pass."

Use the pit just to the south to finish up Level 1, then return by using
the steps in the northwest.

Pull the red lever south of you, which gives access to the room in the center.

Open the west door with the Ruby Key.

Stand on the pad, and it will remove the pit you used before and replace it
with a pad.

Standing on the new pad opens door to the east, where you must pull a red lever.

Move west and south, then go north to the stairs up to Level 3.

Go to the stairs in the north-central area of Level 3 to reach Level 5.

Four Columns
------------

On Level 5, find the Silver key and use it on the west door.

Continue west and open all doors (one leads to a healing chamber).

Go east, open the north door and slay anything that moves.

In the center are four columns: put the Tear in the south column.

Stay close to the walls and go east, where you will put the Heart,
then go north and west to the west column and place the Horn in this column.

Open the door behind you, go north and place the Eye in the north column.
(You must place the items in the order described.)

When you place the Eye, it removes a column north of you: step on either pad
here, and it will send you into the center room to fight the toughest monster
of all.

If you need to escape and heal, stand on the west teleport pad, which
creates a teleport pad to the west; standing on the west one creates a
pad to the north; standing on the north one creates another to the south
that will teleport you out.

When ready to leave, press the button in the northwest room.

You must kill the monster to finish the quest.

Orbs & Stuff
------------

Because the keys are found in such a linear manner that is noted in the solution,
their locations are not listed here.

This directory was decompressed from `hexx-heresy-of-the-wizard.zip`,
except for `README.md`, `runme.sh` (which runs the game in DOSBox
on my MacBook), and of course the zip file itself.

The zip file was downloaded on 2018-02-08 from Abandonia:
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/902/Hexx+-+Heresy+of+The+Wizard.html
http://www.abandonia.com/en/downloadgame/902
It unzips into a new directory named `hexx`. I have flattened
the directory structure in this repository for convenience.
